# JeevanLite OTA Server Repository

This repository serves as the Over-the-Air (OTA) update server for JeevanLite ventilator. It leverages GitHub Releases to host and distribute software updates, allowing users to seamlessly update their firmware versions.

## Overview

This repository plays a crucial role in managing and distributing updates for our JeevanLite ventilator. By creating new releases here, we can effectively roll out new versions of the firmware to our users through an OTA update process, ensuring they always have access to the latest features and improvements.

## How it Works

1. **Release Creation**: Whenever a new version of the firmware is ready for release, our development team creates a new release in this repository. This involves tagging and attaching the necessary firmware binaries as release assets.

2. **Firmware Integration**: Our ventilator is integrated with a mechanism that periodically checks this repository for new releases. When a new release is detected, the ventilator notifies the user and prompts them to download and install the update.

3. **User Updates**: Users can initiate the update process from within the ventilator. The ventilator downloads the latest release assets from this repository and performs the necessary steps to install the update.
